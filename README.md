A Random Forest-Based Approach to Olympic Medal Count Prediction

This study builds a random forest regression model based on data from the Summer Olympic Games between 1960 and 2016, aiming to predict the total number of medals each country would win in the 2020 Olympics. After cleaning and filtering the dataset, certain Olympic years affected by political factors were excluded. The total counts of gold, silver, and bronze medals were used as features for modeling.

The model was validated using data from the 2016 Olympics. Evaluation metrics included Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the coefficient of determination ($R^2$). Experimental results show that the model performs well on the validation set, achieving an $R^2$ of 0.96 and an MSE of 70.70, indicating strong fitting ability.

Further analysis reveals that the model tends to have higher prediction errors for countries with fewer medals, while predictions for leading medal-winning countries are more accurate. The study also provides predictions and visualizations of the total medal counts for major countries in the 2020 Olympics.

Finally, this work discusses potential improvements in feature construction and ensemble learning methods, such as incorporating host country effects, refining medal categories, and using more powerful models like XGBoost to enhance prediction accuracy and robustness in future studies.
